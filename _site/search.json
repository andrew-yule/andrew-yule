    "text": "When To Hang Up The Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n This week’s riddler was too interesting to pass up:\n\n\n\n\n\n Riddler solitaire is played with 11 cards: an ace, a two, a three, a four, a five, a six, a seven, an eight, a nine, a 10 and a joker. Each card is worth its face value in points, while the ace counts for 1 point. To play a game, you shuffle the cards so they are randomly ordered, and then turn them over one by one. You start with 0 points, and as you flip over each card your score increases by that card’s points — as long as the joker hasn’t shown up. The moment the joker appears, the game is over and your score is 0. The key is that you can stop any moment and walk away with a nonzero score.What strategy maximizes your expected number of points?\n\n\n\n\n\n As always, I like to solve these kinds of problems using simulation because it shows just how powerful computational approaches can be.Let’s start first by creating the deck of cards and then we’ll run a bunch of “simulations” by taking a random order of the cards many times.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Next, let’s create a helper function to count of score for the given hand assuming we were to stop at anywhere from 1 - 11, noting however, that if we hit a “J” in one of our hands, we will then get a 0 score for that hand and number of cards combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Next, apply our helper function to the simulations and merge the results for the various number of cards dealt taking the average score.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n We know this is an optimization function of some kind so we should be able to see some kind of global maximum in our results.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n And finally, let’s determine which hand is the optimal one to call it quits for which for this game is at 5 hands with an average likely score somewhere around 15."

    "text": "On-Base Percentage For a Certain Number of Perfect Games\n\n\n\n\n\n I always enjoy reading the weekly Riddler puzzles from 538 (link). My background is not in statistics, but I enjoy the puzzles because they’re typically just the right amount of complexity to solve in a reasonable time frame and the topics are interesting and wide-ranging. When there is one involving sports, it’s even better.Here’s the Riddler express from June 3rd 2021 discussing baseball perfect games:\n\n\n\n\n\n How low would a batter’s chances of reaching base have to be for you to expect one perfect game per season? (You can make the following simplifying assumptions: All batters have the same chances of reaching base; at-bats are independent from each other; there are 30 MLB teams, and each club plays 162 games; and no games go into extra innings.)\n\n\n\n\n\n My preferred computational tool is the Wolfram Language so I’ll take a stab at solving this Riddler using it. \n\n\n\n\n\n First, let’s define some global constants based on what we are allowed to assume.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Now, my preferred approach to a lot of these statistically based Riddler’s is to just simulate them. The primary reason is because I have very little actual formal training in statistics, but also because I believe that modern computers today combined with powerful computation languages, give us a very good way of solving these problems that previously had to be solved using pure mathematics.So, we need a way of simulating a baseball season and to start we will need to create a distribution based on the on-base average. In this case, we can use EmpiricalDistribution and assign a weight based on the on-base average. The resulting output will be either a 1 when the batter gets on base, or a 0 when they do not. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Simulating a full season requires us to randomly sample our on-base distribution for the total number of at bats that we can expect for every game played across each team. Then, to ensure we account for randomness correctly, because this is a simulation, we need to repeat this process a number of times. The more we perform a simulation, averaging the results, the better our prediction will be.RandomVariate lets us sample our distribution a number of times and create nested arrays. In this case we simulate the number of at bats in a game for each team across an entire season 100 times. Then for each simulation we count the number of perfect games we have and take an average across the full number of season simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Simulating each season multiple times for various on-base averages let’s us see how the number of predicted perfect games in a season varies.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n And finally, using the results we can calculate the required on-base average that would lead to one perfect game per season"

    "text": "Improving Operations Through Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n How do you understand thermal-hydraulic behavior in large pipeline networks?\n\n\n\n\n\n This was the exact question I asked myself during some of the recent work we kicked off to look at an onshore midstream hydrocarbon distribution network.Spending the majority of my time working on offshore fields, the technical challenges are obviously there, but the infrastructures you work with are generally pretty simple. A few wells tying into a manifold, followed by a single subsea tieback to a host facility is a typical scenario. Under those conditions, things like temperature and pressure can easily be visualized through profile plots of a particular pipeline like the one below.Compare that to onshore networks, and in particular, midstream companies operating networks, where you can end up with 100’s of pipelines with numerous “sources” or feeds joining the system, and “sinks” or feeds leaving the system. Answering very specific questions about that network can be done, but getting an understanding of the entire system under certain scenarios is difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n Visualization to the rescue!\n\n\n\n\n\n One of the best ways to understand data is to be able to visualize it. When that data is in the context of a geographical layout, then what I have come to realize is that the best approach to visualization should be something that embraces that geographical dependency. Enter heat maps.In the above examples, you can see a few of the visualizations created for some onshore pipeline networks looking at things like temperatures and pressures through a field. In most cases, the coloring of the lines allows for very clear picture of where in the system higher values are located. This helps to understand e.g. where bottlenecks might be which could be caused by insufficiently size pipes or excess flow that needs to be diverted.\n\n\n\n\n\n General workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n So what’s required to make one of these? Well the fundamental process is actually fairly easy to understand, but like anything, the devil is in the details.First, we need a starting GIS file of some kind, which defines our coordinates (lat/longs) of the various pipelines. Next, we need a source of data describing the values we’re interested in displaying for each of the pipelines. Finally, we need to take that data we’re interested in viewing, create an overall scale for it (low to high), and then essentially transpose it with our GIS data.In terms of specifics, the diagram below shows the high-level technology stacks that make this possible. First, a GIS file is used to build a simulation. In my case this is typically PIPESIM, which has the benefits of a.) having built-in GIS support and b.) having a python API. The python API allows for information on the distances of each pipeline along with their coordinates to be extracted automatically. Next, I use the Wolfram Language’s geo-related functions to scale my simulation data along the actual GIS coordinates of a particular pipeline. Finally, the generated data is written into a kml file as plain text where it may be viewed by 3rd party software or loaded back in to the Wolfram Language.\n\n\n\n\n\n Looking ahead\n\n\n\n\n\n Numerous software (PIPESIM included) now have the ability to generate heat maps natively within their user interfaces. What’s unique about this technology is that the end result is a kml file. This allows the heat map to be opened by numerous 3rd party pieces of software such as Google Earth and Global Mapper and probably more importantly, it allows results to be shared easily across entire organizations.I have utilized this technology now on several projects and throughout that process have managed to bring it to a fairly mature state. It can be adapted to all kinds of data sources whether they be simulation / software generated, or actual field data and the GIS data can come from a number of sources as well."

    "text": "How to Create Hans Rosling’s Famous Animated Bubble Chart in Wolfram Language\n\n\n\n\n\n Last week, I came across an interesting Medium article from a Data Science professional I follow. The post walked through creating Hans Rosling’s famous animated bubble chart from one of his Ted Talks regarding how economic prosperity increases life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n The article was interesting and helps to showcase the power of various programming languages. In this particular case, the author was utilizing R and cited it’s “range and flexibility”. His final result was an animated version of the ggplot shown below mimicking Rosling’s original above.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n I love R, but love Wolfram Language even more. So, I wanted to try and show off Wolfram Language's capabilities in this area by re-creating his workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n Criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n The author of the article noted some self-imposed criteria in his workflow:1.    Can I do it using economic data straight from the World Bank source, without needing to use local data files or package data which may not be up to date?2.    Can I make it look reasonably close to how Rosling’s chart looked?3.    Is it possible do to it in a single piped command in R?I will attempt to follow the exact same criteria, with the exception to #3 where I will use “one line” of Wolfram Language code to create the graphic.\n\n\n\n\n\n Grabbing the data\n\n\n\n\n\n In the article, the author noted the use of a 3rd party library with immediate access to the world bank web API for extracting information. This is a really nice convenience, and one that isn’t quite available in that same form in the Wolfram Language. However, it is worth noting that the Wolfram Language does contain a rather comprehensive built-in knowledge database and in particular there are entries for Country data such as GDP per capita and population. Even life expectancy (the final main piece of information needed for this analysis) is available.For the purposes of this analysis though, I wanted to keep with the Author’s intention of using the World Bank API, so for that we will utilize Wolfram Language’s URLExecute command, but first we need to acquire a list of countries we want to possibly grab information on.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n The World Bank API’s prefer to deal explicitly with 2 letter country codes when referencing a particular country, so for that I will again utilize Wolfram’s knowledge base first to generate that for each country.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Before getting any data on the particular countries, the last identifying piece of information we want for the plot later is the region of a particular country so that we can perform grouping within the plot. To get this, I’ll make a call to the World Bank API passing in the country code and then retrieving the reported region.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n After deleting any countries that may have failed due to being unrecognized by the API, I will next plot the number of countries by region to ensure we have successfully retrieved the data as well as to get a sense for areas with the most countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The author of the original article provided the 3 indicators that we need to pass into the World Bank API in order to get our required information. Those are shown below and will provide us with Life Expectancy, GDP Per Capita, and Total Population.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n We’ll now use the World Bank’s API, passing in the above indicators and retrieving information for each country in our list from the years 1960 to 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Next, I’ll save the data so I don’t have to retrieve it via the API again if I close my work and pick back up later.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Retrieving the data can then be performed using the Get[] function.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Now we need to combine the data taking only the properties we’re interested in. Then, we’ll do some rearranging to get it into a more “tidy” format.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Finally, the region information is the only parameters missing from what was extracted in the API calls, so I will add that back in manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n After evaluation, I end up with the following clean data set for making my graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a static chart for a single year\n\n\n\n\n\n Next, I’ll create a function capable of being passed a single year and creating a graphic showing the GDP per capita on the x-axis (plotted on a log scale) and the life expectancy on the y-axis where the size of the bubbles is used to indicate the countries population.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Here are examples of the function in action below.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Animating the chart\n\n\n\n\n\n With a single function (and line of code) we are now able to make a plot for a particular year, the only remaining step is to create all the plots across all the years and then export the resulting images as a GIF!"
