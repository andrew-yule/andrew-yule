My professional interests include flow assurance, data science, statistics, and programming in the Wolfram Language and Python. My personal interests include college football, physical fitness, and cooking.\n\n#### Code\n- [ggplot](https://github.com/ayule89/ggplot) (for Wolfram  Language): This is a Wolfram Language implementation of the popular R package called ggplot. It's one of my favorite side projects, but unfortunately I don't get as much time to work on it as I would like.\n- [wl2md](https://github.com/ayule89/wl2md): Converts a Mathematica notebook into a Markdown notebook. It's essentially a re-write of the m2md package ([link](https://github.com/kubaPod/M2MD)), as I wanted a little more control over the code base and implementation.\n- [andrew-yule](https://github.com/ayule89/andrew-yule): Repository for the majority of the content that makes up this website.\n\n#### Publications and Presentations\n- [PSIG 2021 Conference, A Novel Approach for Pump Timing Optimization](https://onepetro.org/PSIGAM/proceedings-abstract/PSIG21/All-PSIG21/PSIG-2105/463593)\n- [Engineering Alex: A Centralized System for Petroleum Production Analytics](https://www.wolfram.com/customer-stories/centralized-system-petroleum-production-analytics.html)\n- [ggplot: A Grammar of Graphics for the Wolfram Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dmKX_G4MBs)\n- [Wolfram Language for Application Development: How to Take Full Advantage of NETLink`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kmJRv8wrl4)\n- [Lessons Learned from Application Development with the Wolfram Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKOfyGut59s)\n\n#### Links\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-yule-58571b5b/)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ayule89)\n- [Github](https://github.com/ayule89)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"About.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","theme":"litera"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
